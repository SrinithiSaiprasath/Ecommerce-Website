# Ecommerce Store with MERN Stack

## Overview

This project is an ecommerce store built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It incorporates various third-party APIs to enhance its functionality. The store caters to three main user roles: buyers, sellers/merchants, and admins.

## User Flows

### Buyers

Buyers can easily navigate through the store's categories, products, and brands. They have access to a wide range of products and can make purchases with ease.

### Sellers or Merchants

Sellers or merchants have the ability to manage their own brand components within the store. They can add, update, or remove products associated with their brand.

### Admins

Admins have complete control over the entire store components. They can manage users, products, categories, brands, and handle any administrative tasks required.
